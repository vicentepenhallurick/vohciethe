Hello everyone, amp#x200B; I've been trying for a while to make my external monitor/display to work on my Solus laptop.

I purchased Titanfall for my computer about a week ago, and it's been running just fine up until this morning  My issue is this: Started up the game this morning and noticed that, while in game, I was getting these strange 1-2 second lag spikes every ten or twenty seconds  Now, since I've had the game, I have noticed my graphics card is very loud while running it.

So this lappy is old and out of warranty, but wondered if there were any fixes around (BIOS? driver? hardware?) If I pair up my Motorola S305 headphones with the lappy, it works fine but the wifi basically dies - drops to 1Mbps from the normal 18Mbps - and it's stutters. The headphones work fine on my android devices (using the same router and channels for the wifi). I tried different wifi channels but it doesn't help. This is with fedora-28 Gnu/Linux. I tried the original Windows 7 partiti.

A few months ago I realized that half of my 16gb ram was not visible in the system. It has worked flawlessly before, I don't know what caused it to break. I decided to do a clean install of Windows 7 (64 bit) to try and fix it. Didn't work, and now my second GPU isn't detected either. Both GPU's spin up when i boot, but only one is detected. The RAM ( are two sets of 2x4gb sticks. Yes, they are not the same modes, but they worked I've upgraded two computers at my house to Windows 10. Both have had much different results. My Windows 8 laptop upgraded easily and operates nicely with the update. My much faster Desktop went from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and is now super laggy and has been a horrible update. I upgraded both with existing (meaning I didn't do a full wipe and install.but the laptop had nearly nothing on it to begin with). So I have been trying to figure out what my real problems were with the update 
One of our pc's is getting this error when playing some games and it's been happening since the day we got the new video card. The games it has done it with is Dragon Age Inquisition and Second Life. Also today Archeage kept crashing, but without any errors and the fps was horrible (not reaching above 20fps). This pc has a different card then the other one we have, but the same memory and also new. We're not sure what is causing this error.

Hi, I just switched to ubuntu 14.04 and I'm really really new to linux, I don't even know if I installed drivers properly. I run on intel hd 2000 graphics unfortunately, but on windows my performance for that game was still ok. I installed the "intel graphics installer for linux" and it seemed to have installed the drivers, but my performance on cs:go is bad, it's mainly stuttering, but moving seems smooth, if that makes any sense. I felt like I missed something here, so I wanted Reddit, please help me one more time. And once again, sorry for my english. Have a Win7 64 bits. I just bought a VGA adapter with two VGA outputs, and connected my second display on it and it works just fine. When I tried to connect my third monitor, it just duplicate my second dislay. Apparentely, my laptop doesn't detect my third monitor. Is it even possible for me to do this? I would love to extend my laptop to three monitors. What can I do? --- Here are some relevant configurations I specify which game it is because this does not happen with other games. I am connected to the Internet via WiFi. When I am in the game and in a Skype call and end the call everything in the game starts running in place (because I am not getting a connection to the game) and I am disconnected. A friend of mine suggested that it was the router/modem (I don't remember which he said) throttling my speed when it doesn't think I need it, and Skype boosts it up when in a call. Is there anything. Hello everyone. I am running Windows 8.1 and I have problems with my USB ports. Device manager says I have 3 "hubs", 2 of which are: "Intel(R) 6 series/C200 series chipset family USB enhanced host controller" (one is 1C2D and the other one is 1C26). I also have a "Renesas USB 3.0 controller", but I haven't got problems with this one. Basically, when I start my PC I get in one of these situations: -both usb hubs work normally -one of them doesn't work -both don't work Uninstalling the driver. A little background I've noticed that whenever I have multiple apps open, the app which first used sound somewhat locks the audio. Case in point, I have VLC open, and I'm watching a movie. I pause it, then alt-tab to Viber. Viber plays sound whenever I send a message or receive one, and so when I get back to VLC, it doesn't play audio anymore. I have to restart VLC for it to start playing audio again. My current workaround is to mute Viber. Another one, I have Viber open and I'm watching.
