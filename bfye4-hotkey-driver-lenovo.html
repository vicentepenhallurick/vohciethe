Hello, my Lenovo laptop is fairly new and it keeps shutting off randomly (it doesn't completely turn off, the power button brings me back to user page). I suspect it's a keyboard issue, because it only happens when I'm at Uni and when I'm typing in Google Drive, and based on anedoctal evidence I suspect the culprit is the space bar. It's particularly annoying as you can imagine. I've been trying to check if I have any hotkeys involving the space bar and shutting off the power but I can't. Hey!

Volume and the key for the light still work (although my mic mute button also isn't working when it was previously). Not sure how it happened, seeing as it was working perfectly previously. The on screen display for my light was stuck on the screen, so I restarted and the listed Fn keys stopped working.
